Decentralised market for work

After initial testing localhost - we could immediately use devnet? 

To use devnet, print yourself some money 
'''
solana airdrop 1 <RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
'''

I think we'll need to change the name/address or something. 
'''
solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so --url devnet
